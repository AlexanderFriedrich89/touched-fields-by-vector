# touched-fields-by-vector
### **Calculate touched fields by a vector**
Imagine you have a squared grid and each square represents a point with x and y coordinates, e.g. x|y = 0|0, 3|7, ... and so on.
With this Python-Script you can calculate all fields a vector goes through from a start point to an end point.
Just choose an option and enter integer values seperated with whitespace.
It also works in termux-android-app with python3 installed.

The directory ```/dist``` contains a standalone build for Linux.
Go into ```/dist/vector``` and run the executable with 
```sh
./vector
```


Take a look at the example screenshot.
